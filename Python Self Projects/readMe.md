The Password Generator was a code written in one hour.
You need to unlock the permissions in your gmail to send it, mainly the 2 factor authentication in your email should be disabled in order to work. 
Only tested it with Gmail.


The UNO Game, is a console only game, no GUI applied yet.
It is fully working but there are some bugs. It sonsumed a lot of my time, and i will not be developping it for now.

Feel free to pull requests for good changes if you want. 
The final idea, is to use flask and create a multiplayer online game. But since it requires a big knwoledge in the area, i will try to develop it after studying more.


Thank you
